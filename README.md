# Horiseon-Marketing-Optimization

## Description

This refactoring project was completed in order to refine my skills as a new Full Stack Web Developer. I changed the starter code to be much more semantic with the HTML elements and streamline the tags to be more organized. Also, in order to practice making websites more accesible, I added 'alt' tags to all the images. My descriptions will become better with time.

By completing this project, one can test a screen reader to see that images have a proper descrtiption, and I have learned the importance of adding these descriptions is higher than many realize. As a person who does not need to use screen readers, I know that I am lucky and don't have to rely on developers to take the extra step to ensure that I'm able to fully experience what they have created. I will be sure to make my websites accessible for all throughout my career.
